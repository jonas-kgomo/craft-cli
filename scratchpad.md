> Complexity estimated at 4: The task involves providing a detailed response to a user's question, including an example code snippet and explanation of relevant concepts, which is a single-file change and requires amplification of existing knowledge.

> Amplifying reasoning for simple task: Provide a detailed response to the user's question about coding, including an example code snippet and an explanation of the relevant concepts.

> Complexity estimated at 2: This task requires a simple single-file change or an explanation, likely involving a modification to either a welcome message or a welcoming function, hence Amplification.

> Amplifying reasoning for simple task: welcome

> Complexity estimated at 6: Modifying a single message typically involves a refactoring or explanation, but may require consideration of diverse audience perspectives, potentially involving architecture changes to accommodate internationalization or localization. However, the task description implies a relatively simple implementation of a new message, so amplification is the primary concern, not decomposition.

> Amplifying reasoning for simple task: modify the welcome message to better suit a diverse audience
