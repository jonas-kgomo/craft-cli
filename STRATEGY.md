# [-] CRAFT-CLI Strategy & Business Roadmap

## [-] Executive Summary
CRAFT-CLI is not just an AI wrapper; it is a **Factored Cognition Engine** designed for high-velocity engineering. By combining ultra-fast inference (Groq) with a deep reasoning suite (Arrakis) and local codebase indexing, it bridges the gap between a chat bot and a fully autonomous architectural agent.

## [!] Core Capabilities (The Value Proposition)

### 1. Arrakis (Deep Logic Suite)
Unlike standard "assistant" modes, Arrakis implements **Factored Cognition**:
- **Amplification**: Reflexive reasoning that broadens the scope of simple tasks to catch edge cases.
- **Decomposition**: Hierarchical planning that breaks macro-level systems into micro-tasks, ensuring no single step is too complex for the LLM to execute reliably.

### 2. Context Graph (RAG on the Metal)
The system maintains a local `.craft-index.json` which maps the project's architecture, dependencies, and file relationships. This allows the CLI to understand "The Whole" before suggesting "The Part."

### 3. Ultra-Lite TUI (Zero Friction)
Built with Go and Charmbracelet, the interface is designed for 0ms flicker and high information density. It prioritizes a "terminal-first" workflow, allowing developers to stay in the zone without switching to a browser.

## [-] Licensing & Business Model

### Phase 1: Open Core (Adoption)
- **License**: MIT or Apache 2.0 for the CLI framework, local indexing, and basic Groq integration.
- **Goal**: Reach 10,000+ developers by being the fastest, most beautiful terminal agent.

### Phase 2: Arrakis Enterprise (Subscription/Commercial)
- **License**: Business Source License (BSL) for advanced Arrakis features (multi-agent orchestration, architectural synthesis).
- **Feature**: **Remote Context Sync** - Share project indexes across teams so new developers can "onboard" instantly by querying the agent.

### Phase 3: Cognitive Infrastructure (API)
- **Goal**: License the Arrakis Decomposition logic as an API for other companies building autonomous agents.

## [>] Future Roadmap

### Q2 2026: Multi-Agent Spawning
Allow Arrakis to spawn "sub-agents" in the background to handle documentation, test writing, and code implementation in parallel.

### Q3 2026: Visual Context Flow
Implement a web-based or TUI-based visualization of how Arrakis "thinks" through a problem, showing the graph nodes it traverses.

### Q4 2026: WASM/Plugin Ecosystem
Allow community-contributed "Reasoning Plugins" for specific frameworks (e.g., "React Performance Strategy" or "Go Concurrency Guard").
